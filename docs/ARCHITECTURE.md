# Architecture

How Final Showdown is put together. If you want to know *where* something lives or *why* it works the way it does, this is the page.

## Data model

Three tables, one compound unique key. That's the whole thing.

```
┌────────────┐        ┌───────────────┐        ┌────────┐
│    User    │◀──────▶│   JobEntry    │◀──────▶│  Job   │
├────────────┤  1:N   ├───────────────┤  N:1   ├────────┤
│ id (cuid)  │        │ id            │        │ id     │
│ email (uq) │        │ jobId         │        │ company│
│ name       │        │ userId        │        │ position│
│ displayName│        │ status (enum) │        │ link(uq)│
│ image?     │        │ referral(enum)│        │ notes? │
│ createdAt  │        │ updatedAt     │        │ addedBy│
└────────────┘        └───────────────┘        │createdAt│
                      UNIQUE(jobId,userId)     │updatedAt│
                                               └────────┘
```

- **User** — one row per allowlisted friend, keyed by email.
- **Job** — one row per posting. Link is `UNIQUE`, so duplicate imports and duplicate POSTs collapse automatically.
- **JobEntry** — one row per `(job, user)` pair. Holds that user's application status and referral state. `@@unique([jobId, userId])` guarantees there's never more than one.

Why a separate `JobEntry` instead of "Alice Status / Bob Status / …" columns on `Job`? Because adding a 5th or 6th friend is then a data change, not a schema change. Same reason we don't hard-code the user list.

Enums:

```prisma
enum AppStatus       { NONE  APPLIED  APPLIED_WITH_REFERRAL  SKIPPED  REJECTED  EXPIRED  OFFER }
enum ReferralStatus  { NONE  REQUESTED  RECEIVED  NOT_NEEDED }
```

`NONE` is the default for both — an entry with both fields `NONE` is indistinguishable from no entry at all. The seeder takes advantage of this: it skips writing entries that would be all-`NONE`.

### Coupling rules between status and referral

Enforced client-side in `components/status-pill.tsx` so the UI stays consistent:

- Changing your status to `APPLIED_WITH_REFERRAL` auto-sets referral to `RECEIVED`.
- Changing your referral to `RECEIVED` while status is `APPLIED` auto-promotes status to `APPLIED_WITH_REFERRAL`.
- Changing your referral back to `REQUESTED` while status is `APPLIED_WITH_REFERRAL` demotes it to `APPLIED`.

The server trusts whatever the client sends (after authz). If you want to harden this, move the coupling into `app/api/entries/route.ts`.

## Request flow

### Read path — the jobs board (`/`)

1. `app/page.tsx` is a Server Component. It calls `auth()` and then `getAllJobs()` / `getAllUsers()` from `lib/data.ts`.
2. The resulting job list (with nested `addedBy` + `entries`) is passed as a prop to `<JobsBoard>` (a Client Component).
3. `<JobsBoard>` handles all filtering, sorting, and status-pill updates on the client. Filter state lives in URL search params so refreshes are stable.

### Read path — the dashboard (`/dashboard`)

1. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` is a Server Component that calls `getDashboardData()` — a single aggregate query that returns users, timeline, per-user stats, referral queue, and any "import days" (days with 100+ jobs, treated as bulk CSV imports and hidden from the timeline).
2. Charts in `components/charts/` are Client Components wrapping Recharts.

### Write path — editing your status

1. User clicks their own pill → dropdown opens → they pick a new status or referral.
2. `components/status-pill.tsx` applies the coupling rules, optimistically updates local state, and sends `PATCH /api/entries` with `{ jobId, userId, status, referral }`.
3. `app/api/entries/route.ts` validates with zod, checks that `userId === session.user.id` **or** the caller is admin (`isAdminEmail`), then `prisma.jobEntry.upsert` on the compound unique key.
4. If the server rejects, the pill rolls back its optimistic update and shows a toast.

### Write path — creating / editing / deleting a job

- `POST /api/jobs` — any signed-in user; rejects duplicate links with 409.
- `PATCH /api/jobs/[id]` — creator or admin only.
- `DELETE /api/jobs/[id]` — creator or admin only. Cascade deletes associated `JobEntry` rows.

## Auth

- NextAuth v5 (beta) with the Google provider, JWT session strategy (no session rows in Postgres).
- `lib/auth.ts` exports `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut`.
- `callbacks.signIn` enforces the `ALLOWED_EMAILS` allowlist and upserts the `User` row on first sign-in.
- `callbacks.jwt` looks up the DB user id and caches it in the token so server components can do `session.user.id` without an extra query on every request.
- `isAdminEmail(email)` checks against `ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL`.

All API routes start with `const session = await auth();` and return 401 if there's no user id. Authorization (who can edit what) happens after that.

---

## UI primitives

All `components/ui/*` files are shadcn-style wrappers over Radix primitives. They're checked into the repo rather than installed as a dependency so we can tweak them freely. Styling uses Tailwind + `class-variance-authority` for variant handling and `tailwind-merge` via `cn()` for safe class composition.

Theming is driven by `next-themes` (see `components/theme-provider.tsx`). There are three first-class themes — `light` (Paper), `graphite` (Graphite), and `dark` (Carbon) — applied as a class on `<html>`. Graphite and Carbon are both dark-family: `tailwind.config.ts` uses a custom `darkMode` variant so `dark:` utilities match either class. Design tokens live in `app/globals.css`; the visual system is documented in [`DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md), and chart colors are centralized in `lib/chart-colors.ts` (a CVD-validated palette).

## Why these choices

- **Neon over Supabase/RDS.** Free tier, serverless (no idle billing), and the pooled endpoint plays nicely with Next.js serverless routes.
- **JWT sessions, no adapter tables.** With a 5-user allowlist there's no reason to store sessions in Postgres. This also means deploying auth doesn't require running more migrations.
- **Server Components for reads, Client Components for writes + filter state.** Reads happen on the server (no client-side fetch, no waterfall). Filtering 1500 rows is a client job (instant, no network).
- **One aggregate query for the dashboard.** Everything the dashboard needs comes from one call to `getDashboardData()`. Cheap, predictable, easy to cache later.
- **Framer Motion intentionally kept lightweight.** We removed per-row enter/exit animations after seeing search lag on 1500-row filters. See `jobs-board.tsx` for the `useDeferredValue` + in-memory `searchIndex` pattern.
